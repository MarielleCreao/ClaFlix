# About

The Cl√£Flix Project was inspired by the interface of the world's leading streaming site. However, as a personalization, I directed to the world of games.
In this initial project I implemented a Logo with infinite neon effect and two corrousels in Jquery.

obs: Although Jquery is a JavaScript library, somewhat outdated, there are still projects on the market that request it in its development, so I believed it important to apply this knowledge.

obs: This project was a challenge from DIO Bootcamp
